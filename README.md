Game of Life Sucks... Sometimes

This is my version of Game of Life. 
It's simple and for now only Conway's Rules are implemented. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run the game
2. Set chance of generating living cell by sliding Chance to be Alive (0-100) slidern on the left
3. Click CREATE THE WORLD button
  - After creating world You can draw cells with Your mouse (left click). 
  - Clicking on a living cell will kill it :D
4. Slide Simulation speed to... set the speed of simulation ;)
